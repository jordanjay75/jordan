                    Designers have already created new online tools and applications to help prevent cyberbullying. Some are turning to machine learning techniques. These tools teach computer programs to detect certain words or behaviors, such as bullying language on social media.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One research team applied this technique to posts on Instagram. First, they asked human participants to decide whether images and their captions were benign or hurtful. Then they used the features that the humans found to teach their program to distinguish regular posts from aggressive ones.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Right now, social media sites don’t remove aggressive posts unless they’re flagged or reported. But they’ve spent years recording which posts actually do get reported. They could treat these reports just like the Instagram researchers treated their benign/hurtful categories. That is, they could use them to help automatically decide whether posts are aggressive or not. This could help sites stop bullying without waiting for users’ reports.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Automated reporting has already been tested in the real world. One group putting these tools to work is the UK-based Samaritans. The organization gives phone or in-person counseling to people suffering from emotional distress or suicidal thoughts. Their Radar app connected with users’ Twitter feeds, scanning them for language related to distress. It then notified users when their friends seemed to be struggling. The goal was to keep bystanders aware of their friends, and help them offer support if necessary.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The technology was a success, but the Samaritans shut the app down just a week after its release. Radar was good at suggesting that users respond to others’ tweets — too good. Users found that the app had shown their angry or sad tweets to people who hadn’t been the intended audience. They also found that it alerted their friends to tweets that were just venting feelings, rather than actual requests for help. People even received alerts to act on tweets sent by strangers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite their good intentions, the Samaritans failed to take into account how people actually use Twitter. Radar’s designers forgot that not everyone we follow, or who follows us, is a friend. Even if we only follow friends, we might not want them alerted to our every mundane online complaint. Users criticized Radar for invading privacy and violating norms of Twitter use. These criticisms, whether warranted or not, got the app shut down.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Failure or no, the Radar project shows us that prompting bystanders to intervene online is possible. But making these tools work requires that designers keep users and platform norms in mind. If intervention-promoting technologies can’t put users’ needs first, they’re destined to fail.
